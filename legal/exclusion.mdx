Exclusion at Tropical Systems are rare, but do occur. An exlcusion can be applied to a guild or a user and will only be implemented if the Leadership Team sees a need.

We don't take violations of our terms of service lightly at Tropical Systems. We expect all users to uphold our ToS at all times when using the application. Any violation of our terms of service may result in an exclusion.

## What happens when you are excluded?
The process varies between a server and a user but it is very similar. Please refer to the tabs below for more information!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="User Exclusion">
    Each time a command is ran, an exlcusion check is utilized to see if the user using the command is on the exclusion list. If a user is on the exclusion list, the bot will display a reply to the interaction which states:
    > "You have been excluded from this service and cannot run any commands."

    This message is an official reply from Crab and Tropical Systems and cannot be replicated by another user. 
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Guild Exlcusion">
    When a command is ran in an excluded guild, the bot will perform the following process:

    > 1. The bot will direct message the guild owner an emebd which notifies them that the guild has been excluded.
    > 2. The bot will leave the server immediately and cannot be added again unless the exclusion is lifted.

    <Info>If you attempt to add the bot again, the bot will simply leave the server</Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How do I remove my exlucsion?

Exclusions are usually permanent and only lifted on **very** special occasions. But if you wish to appeal your exclusion, please email our legal team at [legal@tropicalsys.com](mailto:legal@tropicalsys.com).
