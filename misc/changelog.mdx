<Update label="September 2025 - Week 2" description="v0.1.1" >
Crab has released many bug fixes and improvements for the second version of our beta testing! We are so thankful to all the amazing beta testing servers for their contributions to this project. 

🍍 **Bug Fixes & Improvements**
> - Updated promotion embed to display the role name. This was due to the issue of the direct message embed displaying "@unknown-role".
> - Added a button to display the server the direct message came from.
> - Changed the search from using the id to using user's. For now it is limited to the most recent 10 logs, we are planning to add pagination very soon.
> - Added confirmation to all void messages. You will need to confirm to delete a log.
> - Fixed records returning an error; emoji's were invalid.

🍃 **Documentation Updates**
> - Updated [Deparmtent Reports](/modules/reports), [Staff Management](/modules/staff-mgmt) to match the new command features.
