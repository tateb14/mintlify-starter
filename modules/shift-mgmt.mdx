  <Tab title="Configure Shift Roles">
    The **On Duty** and **On Break** configuration dropdowns will allow you to select **one** role to set as your **On Duty** role and your **On Break** role which will automatically set hthe roles based on the current shift status.

    To configure the **On Duty** role, select the dropdown menu that displays the text **"On Duty Role"**. Once you have selected it, now select which role you wish to set as the role to be added when the user is **On Duty**.

### Using `/shift manage`
When you type in the command `/shift manage`, you will get an **optional** option to select a shift type. You can choose **one** shift type from the list provided. If your department doesn't allow the shift type you selected, the command will not allow the shift type to be selected.
<Tip>If you do not select a shift type, it will set the shift type to **Default**.</Tip>

### Using `/shift active`
When you run the command `/shift active`, it will display two embeds: one for **Active Personnel** and one for **On Break Personnel**. It will display all personnel that are either **On Duty** or **On Break** in their respective embed.

### Using `/shift admin`
When you run the command `shift admin`, it will output an embed with the option to select a user. When you select a user, and if the user has a department personnel role, it will display another embed that will allow you to manage their shift in many ways. Those ways being:
> - **Edit Shift Time**
> - **Remove a Shift**

<Warning>Each Sunday, all shifts are cleared. We are planning on adding customization for this in the coming weeks.</Warning>
