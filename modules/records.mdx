##  Using the Module

| Command        | Description                                                                    |                   
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------     |
| `/record create` | Creates a record which will be sent for approval by a department supervisor. |
| `/record search`| Allows officers to search for records by using the suspect's Roblox Username   |
| `/record void`  | Allows department **high commanders** to void (delete) a record.  |

### Using `/record create`
When you type in the command `/record create`, you will get three (3) **required** options:
> - `suspect-username`
>   - This will gather a list of all roblox usernames and display then as you type.
> - `record-type`
> - `charges`

And you will also get three (3) **optional** options:
> - `armed`
> - `dangerous`
> - `mentally-ill`

<Tip>When you select each suspect flag, it will allow you to select if the bot should apply the flag to the record. These are made to enhance the roleplay experience and should not be used in a harassing manner.</Tip>
When you input all this information, an embed will be generated and sent to the logging channel and will be pending review. A department **supervisor** or above can then approve or deny the record. The officer who made the record will be DMed when the record was reviewed.

### Using `/record search`
When you run the command `/record search` you will be asked to provide a `suspect-username`. This user will populate with the usernames fetched from Roblox as you type.
<Info>You will have to type the **full username** before it will populate.</Info>

### Using `/record void`
When voiding a punishment using `/record void`, you are **required** to provide the record identification string. Once you run the command, the record will be deleted.
<Warning>This command has no confirmation and once the record is voided, it cannot be accessed again.</Warning>
